# Usage

## Steam API Key

For both development and you'll need a `STEAM_API_KEY`.
You can generate one using your steam account on [the steamstore](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

## Rust

Rust is required for development and installation. To install rust, use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

At some point, I will include a binary that be run directly, but I don't want to do the work to validate cross platform validation.

## Running it

If you want to run it without adding the binary to your path you can use `cargo run <args>`.

If you want to run it locally, you should use `./install-locally.sh`.

> I believe this will work on unix systems like MacOS and Linux. I'm not sure if this will work on Windows, but you should still be able to run it using `cargo run`.
